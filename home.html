                <p>Holy moly! I just redownloaded Minecraft after YEARS OF INACTIVITY! I started with a clean NEW WORLD and set off! I didn’t allow cheats, I didn’t change the seed, I didn’t set the world to large biomes. I did, however, have a bonus chest at start. Reason being, it’s been a while, and this could jumpstart my journey! I created the world and I was spawned on an island. Alone. Nothing on the island but a bonus chest, four torches, and me. And, here we go! The story will continue in the next entry.</p>

            <div class="aboutpost">
            <p>Hi, I'm Matt. I'm a second year Computer Science Major, attending Southern New Hampshire University.</p> 

            <p>My goal is to become a software engineer. Although, game development is something that is appealing to me. All in all, I just want to make a great product; whether that is a video game, a mobile app, an operating system that goes into a smart refrigorator, or anything!</p>
            
            <p>I'm also the happiest man alive to have married my wife, Sandy, over two years ago! We are new parents! Our son, Everett, is five months old now. We also have a shihtzu named Penny.</p>

            <p>With knowledge learned from school and personal projects, some technologies I'm familiar with are:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>HTML</li>
                <li>CSS</li>
                <li>PYTHON</li>
                <li>SQL</li>
            </ul>

            <!--
            <p>I used to film and produce YouTube videos on almost a weekly basis. The videos would be a talk show that I hosted, called MATTtalks. I uploaded over 120 episodes. Topics ranged from the best French Dip and Swiss Sandwich, to stories of my first time horseback riding! I still try to make YouTube videos now, but on a much less regular schedule and far less produced.</p>

            <p>I also used to go to school for photography! I thought I was going to be a photographer, until I decided I wanted to be in front of the camera. My dreams have changed, as I'm sure most of yours have too, and I think I've finally decided what I want to do "when I grow up"; become a software engineer.</p>

                <p>I have had some inkling to start playing FORTNITE again. Reason being, it’s been in the news, so I’m interested in getting back into it. However, this time will be on PC, instead of PS4. Reason being, I work in IT now and I’m loving it. However, that’s not the point of this document.</p> 
                
                <p>The point of this document is, as mentioned I work in IT, so I work on a computer all day, and I get an HOUR lunch break every day! So, I’ve already downloaded Minecraft to my computer so it’s easy to jump right into my world and play! Another reason I’m interested in FORTNITE is that it is FREE! Free is great! My life as a new father, husband, homeowner, and dog-dad, is an expensive one, and free is great! So, here goes FORTNITE!</p>

                <h2>I'm Hooked on The IT Crowd</h2>
                <a href="../blogs/imhookedontheitcrowd.html">open blog</a>
                <p>I’ve been in the market for a new show. Not just any new show; but one that would suit my very distinct needs. See, I like a bit of drama, and a long running series that I can really sink my teeth into. I’ve been jumping show to show for the past few weeks. I seem to get through two seasons straight and then, I’m over it...</p>

                <p>...</p>
                    
                <!--The most recent show I watched was House of Cards! An exciting, yet slow burn, show that followed the rise and fall of Frank Underwood, the Congress Whip. I’m honestly not sure what that means, or if that was his actual title. However, he did whip some votes. 
                    
                Two shows ago, I was all about Blindspot. A show about a woman who arrived in the middle of New York City with elaborate tattoos and no memory. One tattoo has the name of an exciting FBI employee. Then chaos ensues. Episodes have stories weave in and out of nonsense to incredible drama. The visual effects are left much to be desired. 
                    
                Three shows ago was Prison Break, and incredible show about a man whose brother was convicted of a crime he did not commit. The “un-imprisoned” brother decided to break the other brother out of jail. How did he do it? He knew the plans of the prison because he was a structural engineer and knew the plans of the prison. By the end of season one, they’ve broken out. By the end of season two, they’re back in jail. By the end of season three, they’ve broken out. By the end of season four, there are characters that are there that have had no importance on the show and could’ve been completely made up to create this plot for season four. Which seems very real. Then season five comes around and apparently the main character is NOT DEAD. Really poor story, if you ask me. Convenient that the story just so happens to work out that he is not dead, and they must break out of YET ANOTHER PRISON.
                    
                Both House of Cards and Blindspot were shows that really made me want to STOP watching them. I got two seasons in, and I just couldn’t take it any longer. There was nothing that kept me watching. I got completely interested in political science while watching house of cards and that’s all I talked about, for the 3 weeks I was watching that show. My wife did not enjoy those conversations. 
                    
                Something I’ve noticed, is that most shows do not have the entirety of the show planned out beforehand. Obviously, because that would be terrible and no fun for the writers, directors, actors, anyone. But it makes for a better viewing experience to not think that these characters are alive FOR NO OTHER REASON THAN TO SERVICE THE PLOT. 
                    
                Anyways, rant over. The cusp of the matter is: I found a new show. The show is entitled, “The IT Crowd”. Now, I’m only two episodes in so far and I’m madly in love with this show. From what I’ve gathered so far, this show takes place in what seems to be England (based on their accents), and this show follows two gentlemen who are the Information Technology division of their company. When, a new woman is being hired to their company and she lies on her resume, or CV, as they say in the show. On her CV, it states that she is adept in “Computers”, which makes the boss place her as the IT Manager. With her lack of knowledge and the incredibly dorky Moss and Roy, chaos ensues. 
                    
                I’m incredibly devoted to this show now, because I’m in a new career, IT, and I’m thoroughly enjoying the humor! 
                    
                So, that is why, I’m hooked on The IT Crowd!
