        <h2>OH NO, FORTNITE</h2>
        <p>I have had some inkling to start playing FORTNITE again. 
            <!--Reason being, it’s been in the news, so I’m interested in getting back into it. However, this time will be on PC, instead of PS4. Reason being, I work in IT now and I’m loving it. However, that’s not the point of this document. The point of this document is, as mentioned I work in IT, so I work on a computer all day, and I get an HOUR lunch break every day! So, I’ve already downloaded Minecraft to my computer so it’s easy to jump right into my world and play! Another reason I’m interested in FORTNITE is that it is FREE! Free is great! My life as a new father, husband, homeowner, and dog-dad, is an expensive one, and free is great! So, here goes FORTNITE!--></p>

        <p>Holy moly! I just redownloaded Minecraft after YEARS OF INACTIVITY! 
            <!--I started with a clean NEW WORLD and set off! I didn’t allow cheats, I didn’t change the seed, I didn’t set the world to large biomes. I did, however, have a bonus chest at start. Reason being, it’s been a while, and this could jumpstart my journey! I created the world and I was spawned on an island. Alone. Nothing on the island but a bonus chest, four torches, and me. And, here we go! The story will continue in the next entry.--></p>

        <p>Working hard today on sizing.
            <!-- I continue to get distracted on different things. I really enjoying bouncing around to keep me excited about the project, but still struggling with different things.I’m enjoying writing and that’s good. I’ve been posting to my medium page, but that won’t last forever because I will not be renewing my membership, so I need to figure out the sizing and different things for new posts to the site.It’s easy with medium because there is basically a link that “links” to the medium page so I barely have to do any work to get the blog post up to my site.Back to work!--></p>

        <h2>I'm Hooked on The IT Crowd</h2>
        <p>I’ve been in the market for a new show. 
            <!--Not just any new show; but one that would suit my very distinct needs. See, I like a bit of drama, and a long running series that I can really sink my teeth into. I’ve been jumping show to show for the past few weeks. I seem to get through two seasons straight and then, I’m over it.The most recent show I watched was House of Cards! An exciting, yet slow burn, show that followed the rise and fall of Frank Underwood, the Congress Whip. I’m honestly not sure what that means, or if that was his actual title. However, he did whip some votes.Two shows ago, I was all about Blindspot. A show about a woman who arrived in the middle of New York City with elaborate tattoos and no memory. One tattoo has the name of an exciting FBI employee. Then chaos ensues. Episodes have stories weave in and out of nonsense to incredible drama. The visual effects are left much to be desired.Three shows ago was Prison Break, and incredible show about a man whose brother was convicted of a crime he did not commit. The “un-imprisoned” brother decided to break the other brother out of jail. How did he do it? He knew the plans of the prison because he was a structural engineer and knew the plans of the prison. By the end of season one, they’ve broken out. By the end of season two, they’re back in jail. By the end of season three, they’ve broken out. By the end of season four, there are characters that are there that have had no importance on the show and could’ve been completely made up to create this plot for season four. Which seems very real. Then season five comes around and apparently the main character is NOT DEAD. Really poor story, if you ask me. Convenient that the story just so happens to work out that he is not dead, and they must break out of YET ANOTHER PRISON.Both House of Cards and Blindspot were shows that really made me want to STOP watching them. I got two seasons in, and I just couldn’t take it any longer. There was nothing that kept me watching. I got completely interested in political science while watching house of cards and that’s all I talked about, for the 3 weeks I was watching that show. My wife did not enjoy those conversations.Something I’ve noticed, is that most shows do not have the entirety of the show planned out beforehand. Obviously, because that would be terrible and no fun for the writers, directors, actors, anyone. But it makes for a better viewing experience to not think that these characters are alive FOR NO OTHER REASON THAN TO SERVICE THE PLOT.Anyways, rant over. The cusp of the matter is: I found a new show. The show is entitled, “The IT Crowd”. Now, I’m only two episodes in so far and I’m madly in love with this show. From what I’ve gathered so far, this show takes place in what seems to be England (based on their accents), and this show follows two gentlemen who are the Information Technology division of their company. When, a new woman is being hired to their company and she lies on her resume, or CV, as they say in the show. On her CV, it states that she is adept in “Computers”, which makes the boss place her as the IT Manager. With her lack of knowledge and the incredibly dorky Moss and Roy, chaos ensues.I’m incredibly devoted to this show now, because I’m in a new career, IT, and I’m thoroughly enjoying the humor!So, that is why, I’m hooked on The IT Crowd!.--></p>

        <h2>It begins.</h2>
        <p>I’m developing a personal website. 
            <!--From nothing. I’m writing in HTML and CSS, as that’s all I know. It’s coming very slowly. My goal is to have version 0.1 released January 1, 2021.I’m a “content creator” and I make YouTube videos at YouTube.com/bramermatt. I also used to be a photographer and I have a photography Instagram at Instagram.com/bteamphoto. So, I thought on this site I could post my videos and phots to the site.I also want to blog, and write reviews.This site will be my first ever development project released. I’ve tried many times to create this site.It always ends with no resolve.Here is to many more updates on the site!--></p>
